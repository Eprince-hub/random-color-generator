# random-color-generator

I am joining the Upleveled full-stack web development Bootcamp that is starting
in September 6 2021 and i am just making this random color generator so that i
can have some practice with javascript that i have been learning from the online
prep course that all the students would have to take before joining the
Bootcamp.

when the page first loaded, it has a base black background but when you start
clicking the button at the bottom which says "Generate Random Color" then the
generated color will be displayed with the Hex value and rgb value.

I couldn't get it to work like i wanted it so i am still going to come back to
it. I would want it to generate all most all the colors there is but for now it
is a little bit limited. If you have any improvement. You are welcome to
contribute.

The code and everything there is, is 100% free,, use it anyhow you want it!.
